## 1 Overview

**Welcome to the landing page of Librehealth Radiology!** This repository contains the Librehealth Radiology Module (librehealth-radiology - previously called radiologydcm4chee and forked from the openMRS radiology module) which is a module adding capabilities of a Radiology
Information System (RIS) onto [Librehealth EHR](https://gitlab.com/librehealth/LibreEHR). The project's primary objectives are to develop a information management module for use in a radiology department, by: 

1. identifying a radiology department's workflow according to radiology experts
2. composing user stories in the areas of image study scheduling, ordering, reporting, viewing and analytics on behalf of radiologist and non-radiologist users.
3. implementation of the module to run on the [librehealth toolkit](https://gitlab.com/librehealth/lh-toolkit)
4. maintenance and quality control parameters as set by the community

### 2.3 Understanding the Radiology Workflow
The following resources will help with understanding the basic infrastructure behind radiology workflow and radiology information systems:

* [Informatics - Radiology Workflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czApoO5N9K8): A youtube video which introduces the concepts behind hospital EHR infrastructure, HL7 and radiology information system by following a patient through the hospital and radiology department.
* [Writing effective user stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6q5-cVeNjCE): A youtube video which introduces the concepts and framework of developing user stories and outlines the techniques and motivations behind writing effective ones.
* [Overview of Radiology information Systems and EMR](https://www.acr.org/~/media/ACR/Documents/PDF/Advocacy/IT%20Reference%20Guide/IT%20Ref%20Guide%20RISEMR.pdf): A PDF document which outlines the importance of a radiology information system and serves as a good overview for describing core functionalities which can be used to guide the development of user stories prior to implementation of the module.


## 3 Build, Install and Run

For full instructions visit the repository's [wiki page](https://gitlab.com/librehealth/lh-radiology/wikis/home). Java JDK 8 and Maven can be used for building the module. The easiest way to install and run the module is via a Docker Container. Demo data can also be configured.
